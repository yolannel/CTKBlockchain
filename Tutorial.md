# Let's demo the Chaos Toolkit using a Simple Blockchain!
Blockchains are interesting concepts to test using chaos engineering principles.
This is because they operate based on user usage, taking advantage of a network of
participants and internal algorithms to create a distributed, decentralized ledger.

This tutorial will *not* focus on teaching core blockchain concepts. While the setup may be done
by simply pulling from my github repository, you may alternatively invest some time reading through
the great tutorial [here](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)!

If you choose to proceed with the tutorial, you will need to ensure that your HTTP requests
match logically with those in this tutorial.

Ready? Great! Let's get started.
